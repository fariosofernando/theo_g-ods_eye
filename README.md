# Theo

   Theo (God's Eye) is a script that sends information from your server (local/remote) to a specified location (until the current version, information is sent to a specified discord channel).

   Theo has two main tools, `Processes` and `Watch Dog`.

   Processes Features:

      1. CPU Usage
      2. RAM memory usage
      3. Disk Usage
      4. Running processes
      5. System Logs

   Watch Dog Features:

      1. Listen to .log file creation events in a folder

# RUN tools

## Watch Dog

1. **Clone the repository (main):**

   Go to your $HOME directory and clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/fariosofernando/theo_gods_eye.git
   ```

   After the clone, you should be able to locate the folder by running:

   ```sh
   cd $HOME/theo_gods_eye/
   ```

2. **Create a service file for `systemd`:**

 First, create a service file in the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory:

 ```sh
 sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/watch_dog.service
 ```

3. **Edit the service file:**

   Add the following content to the file. Be sure to adjust the paths as needed.

   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=Watch Dog Service
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   ExecStart=$HOME/theo_gods_eye/bin/watch_dog.exe
   WorkingDirectory=$HOME/theo_gods_eye/bin/
   Restart=always
   Environment=DOTENV_PATH=$HOME/theo_gods_eye/.env
   User=your_user

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

4. **Reload the `systemd` service files:**

   After creating and editing the service file, reload the service files so that `systemd` recognizes the new configuration.

   ```sh
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

5. **Enable and start the service:**

   Enable the service so that it starts automatically at system startup and then starts the service.

   ```sh
   sudo systemctl enable watch_dog.service
   sudo systemctl start watch_dog.service
   ```

6. **Check service status:**

   To check if the service is running correctly, use the command:

   ```sh
   sudo systemctl status watch_dog.service
   ```

# Conclusion

   Currently the tools send information to a specific channel in the `.env` file that must be placed in the `$HOME/theo_gods_eye/.env` folder with the following variables:

   ```
   CHANNEL_ID = ""
   TOKEN = ""
   LOG_PATH = ""
   ```

   You must have a `.env.example` file with these variables. You can take advantage of this.
